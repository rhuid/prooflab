* Making new types from old types
** Subtypes
*** Elements of the base type satisfying some predicate
** Quotients
*** Equivalent classes
*** Setoids in Lean ... types with equivalent classes
*** Setoids are typeclasses/structures
*** Setoid constructor: relation r, proof that r is equiv relation
*** Quotient is the new type made from Setoid
*** Lifting functions
**** f : quotient \to ...
**** if a and b are equivalent, then f(a) = f(b)
**** Use quotient.lift
*** Our integer example
**** a, b : Nat, (a, b) represents the integer a - b
**** (a, b) equivalent to (c, d)
***** ( a - b ) = ( c - d ) .... \to .... ( a + d ) = ( b + c )
**** Lifting function
***** ( a - b ) + ( c - d ) = ( a + c ) - ( b + d )
