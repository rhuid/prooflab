#+title: Lean (thesis mid presentation)
* Basics of Lean
** Type theory
** Functional language
*** Functors and monads
** Extensibility (syntax, macros)
*** Lean compiler is written in Lean
** Theorem prover or proof assistant
*** Core: tactics, lambdas
*** Demos: propositional logic, first order logic
*** Mathlib
*** Metaprogramming
*** Program verification (Hoare logic, operational semantics)
*** A general purpose programming language
**** Show a small demo (my expenses calculator or markdown converter)
* Loom
** Weakest precondition generator via transformer monad algebras
* A small imperative style language
** Syntax defined in Lean
** Semantics
** Verification (show a simple snippet?)
* TPIL
** tactics
*** apply: command for constructing function application interactively
**** apply And.intro ha hb
**** (a \to b \to a and b)
*** intro: command for constructing function abstractions interactively
**** intro ha hb
** Automation
**** rw
***** surgical tool for manipulating a goal or hypothesis
***** apply substitutions to goals and hypothesis, providing a convenient way of working with equality
**** simp
***** a number of identities in Lean's library have been tagged with the [simp] attribute
***** simp tactic uses them to iteratively rewrite subterms in an expression
